Instead, their skeletons are made of cartilage, the same flexible tissue that your ears and nose are made of. These skeletons are much lighter than bone, and help sharks remain mobile and buoyant in the water. "

Band pairs are counted like rings on a tree and then scientists assign an age to the shark based on the count. Thus, if the vertebrae has 10 band pairs, it is assumed to be 10 years old. Recent studies, however, have shown that this assumption is not always correct. Researchers must therefore study each species and size class to determine how often the band pairs are deposited because the deposition rate may change over time. Determining the actual rate that the bands are deposited is called 'validation'."
